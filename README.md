# Robust RGB-D Salient Object Detection via Channel-wise Deep Fusion

This repository contains code for paper "Robust RGB-D Salient Object Detection via Channel-wise Deep Fusion".
* The "Ours" folder contains the source code of our network, which utilizes original RGB and depth maps to calculate the saliency maps.
* The "Ours+" folder contains the source code of our improved network, which replaces the original depth maps with the saliency predictions generated above.
